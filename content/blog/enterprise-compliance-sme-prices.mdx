A recruitment agency in Manchester hires roughly 50 temporary workers a year. Each one needs a background check — right-to-work verification, identity confirmation, and depending on the role, a DBS check. At current market rates, that's **£50 to £200 per check**. For a business turning over £300,000, that's a compliance bill of £2,500 to £10,000 annually — just to verify that their people are who they say they are.

So what happens? They skip it. Not all of it. But enough of it. The checks get delayed, shortened, or replaced with a quick glance at a passport photo. The paperwork gets filed as "pending." The temp starts Monday regardless.

This is not a story about one agency. It is the reality for millions of small businesses across the UK.

## The SME Compliance Paradox

The UK has approximately **5.5 million SMEs**. They account for over 99% of all businesses and roughly 60% of private sector employment. They are the backbone of the economy — and they face the same regulatory penalties as the largest enterprises in the country.

When the [Fair Work Agency launches in April 2026](/blog/fair-work-agency-april-2026/), its enforcement powers apply universally. **£60,000 in civil penalties per illegal worker.** Up to **5 years' imprisonment** for serious offences. Whether you're a FTSE 250 company with a dedicated compliance team or a 10-person recruitment firm with one admin assistant, the fines are identical.

This is the SME compliance paradox: **the regulatory burden is the same, but the resources to meet it are vastly different.**

Large enterprises absorb compliance costs as a line item. They have HR departments, legal teams, dedicated compliance officers, and enterprise software licences that cost six figures a year. An SME has none of this. They have a founder who does payroll on Sundays and an accountant who comes in once a quarter.

## The Hidden Cost of Doing Nothing

When verification is too expensive, businesses don't eliminate the risk — they just stop measuring it. The consequences are predictable:

- **Unverified workers enter the workforce.** Not necessarily malicious — most are simply undocumented. But undocumented is unlawful, and the liability sits with the employer.
- **Audit trails don't exist.** When there's no system, there's no record. When an inspector arrives, there's nothing to show them.
- **Compliance becomes reactive.** Problems surface when something goes wrong — a visa overstay, a fraudulent document, an incident on site — rather than being caught during routine verification.
- **The fine dwarfs what the check would have cost.** A single £60,000 penalty would pay for verification of every worker at that Manchester recruitment agency for the next 50 years.

The maths isn't complicated. The problem is that verification has been priced for enterprises, not for the businesses that need it most.

## Why Background Checks Are So Expensive

Traditional background checks are expensive because they were designed for high-stakes, low-volume scenarios. Financial services running deep due diligence on a senior hire. Government agencies conducting security clearance. Companies making a significant investment in a permanent employee.

These checks are thorough, manual, and slow. They involve pulling records from multiple databases, cross-referencing documents, and often a human reviewer making a judgment call. The cost reflects the labour involved.

But the compliance landscape has changed. The Fair Work Agency isn't asking whether your managing director has a clean record. It's asking whether the temporary worker who started on Tuesday has the right to work in the UK. That's a fundamentally different question — and it shouldn't require a fundamentally expensive answer.

## What "Enterprise Compliance at SME Prices" Actually Means

Bringing compliance costs down to a level that SMEs can absorb isn't about cutting corners. It's about matching the verification method to the risk.

Right-to-work verification doesn't require a six-week background investigation. It requires confirming that a person is who they claim to be, that their documents are genuine, and that their permission to work is current. Done digitally, with the right infrastructure, this can happen in seconds — not weeks.

Certifyd's pricing is built around this reality:

- **Usage-based pricing** — you pay per verification, not per licence seat or annual subscription
- **£0.60 to £1.50 per check** depending on volume — a fraction of the cost of traditional background checks
- **No minimum commitments** — a 10-person business pays the same rate structure as a 10,000-person enterprise
- **Full audit trail included** — every check generates a timestamped, tamper-proof record that satisfies FWA inspection requirements

For that Manchester recruitment agency hiring 50 temps a year, the annual cost drops from £2,500-£10,000 to **£30-£75**. That's the difference between a cost that gets skipped and a cost that gets absorbed without a second thought.

## The Dashboard That Levels the Playing Field

Cost is only half the equation. The other half is capability. Enterprise compliance platforms give large businesses something SMEs have never had: **a single view of their entire workforce's compliance status**.

Certifyd provides that same dashboard to every business, regardless of size. One screen showing every worker, their verification status, upcoming expiry dates, and a complete audit history. When the FWA arrives, it's the same "here's our dashboard" conversation — whether you employ 50 people or 50,000.

The Fair Work Agency doesn't care about your company's size. Your compliance solution shouldn't either.

## The Bottom Line

The gap between regulatory expectations and SME resources has been growing for years. The Fair Work Agency closes the enforcement gap — but without affordable verification, it risks punishing the businesses least equipped to comply.

Verification should be cheap enough that nobody skips it. Comprehensive enough that it satisfies an inspector. And simple enough that it doesn't require a compliance team to operate.
