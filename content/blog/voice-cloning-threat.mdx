It takes **30 seconds of audio** to clone a human voice with 99.8% accuracy. Not thirty minutes. Not a lengthy recording session. Thirty seconds — roughly the length of a voicemail greeting, a conference call introduction, or a podcast clip.

That means if your voice exists anywhere on the internet — a company bio video, a LinkedIn post, a webinar, a YouTube interview — it can be cloned. And that clone can call your CFO this afternoon and ask them to approve a wire transfer.

This is not a future threat. It is happening now.

## The Ferrari Incident

In mid-2024, Ferrari's CFO received a phone call from someone who sounded exactly like the company's CEO. The caller discussed a confidential acquisition and asked the CFO to process an urgent wire transfer. The voice was convincing. The cadence, the tone, the speech patterns — all matched.

The CFO was moments away from authorising the payment. Then he did something unusual: he asked a personal question. Something only the real CEO would know. The caller couldn't answer. The line went dead.

Ferrari avoided a significant financial loss because one executive happened to ask the right question at the right moment. (A similar incident — the [Arup deepfake attack](/blog/arup-deepfake-attack/) — cost another firm $25.6 million when the verification layer failed.) But here's the uncomfortable truth: **most people won't think to do that.** And even if they do, the next generation of voice clones will be trained on enough data to answer personal questions too.

## "I Recognised His Voice" Is No Longer Valid Security

For decades, voice recognition has been an informal but deeply trusted form of identity verification. You recognise your boss on the phone. You recognise your colleague. You recognise the person from the bank.

That trust is built on an assumption that is now false: **that a human voice is unique and unforgeable.**

Today's AI voice synthesis tools — many of them freely available — can replicate not just a voice's pitch and tone, but its emotional texture, speaking rhythm, accent variations, and even the way someone pauses mid-sentence. The output is indistinguishable from the real person to the human ear.

This breaks the entire informal verification layer that businesses and individuals have relied on since the telephone was invented. Every phone call is now an unverified channel. Every voice you "recognise" could be synthetic.

## The Attack Surface Is Enormous

Voice cloning attacks aren't limited to CEO fraud. Consider the range of scenarios:

- **A "client" calls your accounts team** to change payment details. The voice matches previous calls. Your team processes the change. The money goes to a fraudster's account.
- **A "hiring manager" calls a recruitment agency** to request CVs be sent to a new email address. The agency complies. Hundreds of candidates' personal data is now compromised.
- **A "family member" calls an elderly relative** asking for emergency money. The voice is their grandchild's. The grandparent transfers the funds immediately.
- **A "supplier" calls your procurement team** to confirm a new bank account for invoice payments. The voice matches the usual contact. The redirect is processed.

Each of these requires nothing more than a short audio sample and a commercially available AI tool. The barrier to entry is negligible. The potential damage is catastrophic.

## Why Existing Defences Don't Work

Traditional responses to phone fraud — callback procedures, verification questions, manager approval chains — all assume that **if you're speaking to the right voice, you're speaking to the right person**. That assumption is gone.

Callback procedures help if the fraudster initiated the call, but they don't help if the attacker has also spoofed the phone number. Verification questions work only if the answers aren't available through social engineering or data breaches — and they usually are. Manager approval adds a step, but if the manager also trusts the voice, you've just added another person to fool.

The fundamental problem is that **voice is being treated as an authentication factor when it is no longer one.**

## What Replaces Voice Recognition

If voice can't be trusted, what can?

The answer is cryptographic verification — something that can't be cloned, replayed, or synthesised. A QR code that refreshes every 30 seconds creates a verification challenge that no voice clone can answer. It doesn't matter how perfect the synthetic voice is if the verification happens through a separate, cryptographic channel.

Mid-call, a verification request is triggered. Both parties scan a QR code. The cryptographic handshake confirms that both participants are who they claim to be — verified against their authenticated identity, not their voice. The process takes 30 seconds. The call continues with certainty.

This works on video calls too, where deepfake video adds a visual layer to the same attack. When both voice and video can be faked, the only reliable verification is one that doesn't depend on either.

## The Window Is Closing

Voice cloning technology is improving faster than defences against it. Every month, the audio sample required gets shorter, the output gets more convincing, and the tools become cheaper and more accessible.

Organisations that continue to treat phone calls as a verified channel are operating on borrowed time. The Ferrari CFO got lucky. The next target won't ask the right personal question. The next voice clone will be trained on enough data to answer it anyway.

The phone call isn't proof of identity anymore. It's just a channel. And every channel needs verification.
