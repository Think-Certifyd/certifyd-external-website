Every business runs on trust in who people are. That trust is broken.

Whether you're hiring someone you've never met, letting a tradesperson into your home, or relying on agency staff to look after your elderly parent — you're trusting that people are who they say they are. And right now, there's no affordable, simple way to verify that.

## The problem is everywhere

A recruiter asks "Do you have the right to work in the UK?" and the candidate says "Yes." Three weeks of interviews later, they discover it's a graduate visa that needs £20,000 in sponsorship. Or they start over.

A homeowner finds a builder online. He knows where she lives, what's in her home, when she's out. She knows nothing about him. He sends his mate instead. No one checks.

A care home has rotating agency staff covering nights and weekends. Residents' families have no idea who's looking after their elderly parent. A staff member gives a false name. Nobody checked. Nobody could.

## What we're building

Certifyd is the first affordable, pre-screening identity verification layer for businesses. We combine real-time person-to-person authentication, right-to-work compliance, and audit-ready record-keeping in a single platform.

Two-way verification. Platform agnostic. Affordable. Universal.

We're just getting started, and we'd love to hear from you. If identity verification matters to your business, [get in touch](/contact/).
